# How to contribute

We try to maintain a clean coding standard, this means that we have some guidlines 
that need to be followed to contribute to our repositories.

By not following our contribution guidelines without the consultation of at least
one of your teammates you comply with treating the entire team with something
delicious.

## Getting started

* Make sure that you have a [Gitlab account](http://gitlab.prd.hostengine.be/) with
with access to the repository in which you want to contribute.
* Submit a [Gitlab issue](http://gitlab.prd.hostengine.be/dashboard/issues) that 
clearly describes the purpose of your contribution.
There is no need to create issues for trivial changes.

## Making changes
* Clone the repository to your local working machine and start out by making the
necessary changes within the **development** branch.
* Push your local changes to the **development** branch and test if your changes
are working correctly.
* If all your tests succeed then push to the **staging** branch and later to the
**production** branch.
